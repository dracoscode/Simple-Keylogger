# Simple-Keylogger
# Python Keylogger for Cybersecurity Education

This repository contains code for a Python-based keylogger developed as part of an undergraduate cybersecurity research project. The primary purpose of this keylogger is educational, aiming to help students and researchers understand system vulnerabilities and potential mitigation strategies. All activities carried out with this tool must be legal and ethical.

# Project Overview

The keylogger developed in Python demonstrates how malicious entities can exploit system vulnerabilities. It captures, stores, and transfers keystrokes, simulating a real-world cyber threat. The keylogger is also incorporated into a broader cybersecurity educational toolkit, helping simulate and understand cyber threats.

# Features

Key Capture: Records user's keystrokes in a log file.
Log Storage: Stores log file in a hidden location.
Log Transfer: Option to send the log file to a pre-configured email (for testing and educational purposes).
